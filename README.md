My Favorite Movies App

A simple and intuitive CRUD web application that allows users to search for movies, add them to a personal list, and write reviews and ratings for each movie. The app integrates with the OMDb API to fetch movie details and provides a seamless experience for managing your favorite movies.

Features:

Search Movies: Search for movies by title using the OMDb API.

Add Movies: Add movies to your list with a custom review and rating.

Edit Movies: Update the review and rating for any movie in your list.

Delete Movies: Remove movies from your list.

Local Storage: Your movie list is saved locally, so it persists even after refreshing the page.

How It Works:

Search: Enter a movie title in the search bar. The app will display a dropdown list of matching movies.

Select: Click on a movie from the dropdown to view its details.

Review & Rate: Write a review and rate the movie (on a scale of 1 to 10).

Add: Submit the form to add the movie to your list.

Edit: Click the "Edit" button on any movie in your list to update its review and rating.

Delete: Click the "Delete" button to remove a movie from your list.

Future Enhancements:

Add a "Watchlist" feature to track movies you want to watch later.
